# British Time Converter

## Description

In British English, the expression "half [hour]" is used colloquially to denote 30 minutes past the hour. For example, "half ten" means 10:30
(without specifying morning or night). This is itself an abbreviation of an older colloquialism, "half 'past' ten". The abbreviation can cause
misunderstanding with non-British English speakers as this contrasts with many European languages, where the same type of expression
denotes 30 minutes before the hour. For example, in Czech, pl desáté ("half ten") means 9:30. Another example, in German, halb zehn ("half
ten") means 9:30.
